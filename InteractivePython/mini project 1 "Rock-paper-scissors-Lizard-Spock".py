# Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock template

# The key idea of this program is to equate the strings
# "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", "Spock" to numbers
# as follows:
#
# 0 - rock
# 1 - Spock
# 2 - paper
# 3 - lizard
# 4 - scissors

# helper functions
import random


def number_to_name(num):
    # fill in your code below
    # convert number to a name using if/elif/else
    # don't forget to return the result!
    pass

    
def name_to_number(name):
    # fill in your code below
    # convert name to number using if/elif/else
    # don't forget to return the result!
    pass


def rpsls(name): 
    # fill in your code below

    # convert name to player_number using name_to_number

    # compute random guess for comp_number using random.randrange()

    # compute difference of player_number and comp_number modulo five

    # use if/elif/else to determine winner

    # convert comp_number to name using number_to_name
    
    # print results
    pass
    
# test your code
